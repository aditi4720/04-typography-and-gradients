      <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum</h2>
      <p>Every selector in CSS has a specificity weight. A selector’s specificity weight, along with its placement in the cascade, identifies 
        how its styles will be rendered. In Lesson 1, “Building Your First Web Page,” we talked about three different types of selectors: 
        the type, class, and ID selectors. Each of these selectors has a different specificity weight. The type selector has the lowest
        specificity weight and holds a point value of 0-0-1. The class selector has a medium specificity weight and holds a point value of 
        0-1-0. Lastly, the ID selector has a high specificity weight and holds a point value of 1-0-0. As we can see, specificity points are 
        calculated using three columns. The first column counts ID selectors, the second column counts class selectors, and the third column
        counts type selectors. What’s important to note here is that the ID selector has a higher specificity weight than the class selector, 
        and the class selector has a higher specificity weight than the type selector.</p>
      <h2>Why do we use it</h2>
      <p>When selectors are combined they should be read from right to left. The selector farthest to the right, directly before the opening 
        curly bracket, is known as the key selector. The key selector identifies exactly which element the styles will be applied to. Any 
        selector to the left of the key selector will serve as a prequalifier. The first combined selector above, .hotdog p, includes two 
        selectors: a class and a type selector. These two selectors are separated by a single space. The key selector is a type selector 
        targeting paragraph elements. And because this type selector is prequalified with a class selector of hotdog, the full combined 
        selector will only select paragraph elements that reside within an element with a class attribute value of hotdog. The second selector 
        e, .hotdog p.mustard, includes three selectors: two class selectors and one type selector.</p>
      <h2>Lorem Ipsum <br> Dummy Text
      </h2>
      <p>To set one value for the top and bottom and another value for the left and right sides of an element, specify two values: top and bottom
        first, then left and right. Here we are placing margins of 10 pixels on the top and bottom and margins of 20 pixels on the left and right. 
        Borders fall between the padding and margin, providing an outline around an element. The border property requires three values: width, 
        style, and color. Shorthand values for the border property are stated in that order—width, style, color. In longhand, these three values 
        can be broken up into the border-width, border-style, and border-color properties. These longhand properties are useful for changing, or 
        overwriting, a single border value.</p>
